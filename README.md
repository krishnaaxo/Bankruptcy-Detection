# Company Bankruptcy Prediction 
Bankruptcy is a legal process through which people or other entities who cannot repay debts to creditors may seek relief from some or all of their debts.In this project i have done a detailed EDA and feature selection on the dataset of Company from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009.Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.EDA is perfomed with the help of Sweetviz and Autoviz library which help in much more detailed analysis of the dataset. I have also performed a detailed data-preprocessing by handling undersampling,oversampling and outliers.Features selection was done by eliminating constant features and least correlated features.Later i have classification with the help of grid search cv and find the best algorithm and their respective parameters which helped me to achieve an accuraccy of 99%.
